# Facebook-Image-to-ASCII
A program I made for a hackathon in 2015 that will convert an image to ASCII characters, formatted for Facebook statuses.

To download this project, simply download the zip or run this command in the command line:

<code>git pull https://github.com/chenchik/Facebook-Image-to-ASCII.git master</code>

When I made this project, a facebook status on a regular desktop was 33 "@" characters wide. This might not be the case anymore.
